1. The first step in Refactoring is to ensure that I have a solid set of tests for that section of code. The tests are essential because even though I
will follow refactorings structured to avoid most of the opportunities for introducing
bugs, Iâ€™m still human and still make mistakes. The larger a program, the more likely it
is that my changes will cause something to break inadvertently.

- Extract Function
- Replace Temp with Query
- Inline Variable
- Change Function Declaration
